# Covid19-time-series-prediction
This project shows on how to perform prediction for Covid-19 cases on previous number of cases.

## Project Description
1. Objective : Leverage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future covid-19 cases based on historical data, offering valuable insights to support public health management.

2. Expected Outcome : Deliver a reliable predictive model to anticipate covid-19 trends, enabling informed decision-making for resource allocation and effective public health intervention.
